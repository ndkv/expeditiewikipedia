<h3>Chapter 3: St. Vincent to Dakar</h3>

<p>After leaving the port of St. Vincent, the K18 made a detour n its voyage to Dakar. The Dutch Navy had commanded the K18 to assist in the Atlantic crossing of the aircraft, the 'Snip', the first cross-Atlantic Christmas mail flight of the KLM. The Dutch Navy commanded the K18, after being a navigation beacon for the 'Snip', to continue progress its voyage towards the Mid Atlantic Rise, enabling professor Vening Meinesz to perform some remarkable measurements of the ocean floor and its gravity signal. The professor wrote: 

<blockquote>The soundings over the Mid Atlantic Rise showed an irregular topography, suggesting a volcanic landscape.</blockquote> 

This is what the professor and the sounding crew of the K18 saw:</p>

<p>One would expect that the sea floor would be deepest in the middle of the ocean. However, the soundings became shorter and irregular towards the Mid Atlantic Rise, peaking exactly when the K18 was above it. Depths of only 2.5 km where measured, while a few days ago depths of almost 6 km where observed, which were closer to the coast. This paradox puzzled already many people those days, but what prof. Vening Meinesz observed was that the sea floor became more irregular when approaching the Mid Atlantic Ridge. This new detailed observation of that area gave clues of volcanic activity near the oceanic ridge.</p>
 
<p>With his measurement equipment, professor Vening Meinesz also captured the gravity signal of those locations. The spatial resolution of the gravity measurements is coarser, but the rough terrain close to the mid Atlantic Rise is still visible. In this chapter, the following observations are inspected:</p>

<p>The gravity anomalies stay constant for most of the trip, but at 900 km from the port of St. Vincent they start to grow. The K18 is approaching the Mid Atlantic Rise and this is even visible in the gravity measurements of prof. Vening Meinesz. The spreading ridge is especially visible in the gravity measurements because uprising mantle material causes an uplift of the ocean floor as well as a rising in gravitational attraction. More mass is situated in the ridge than the stable situation away from the ridge. It was prof. Vening Meinesz that first saw this phenomenon, because of his extreme accurate gravity observations.</p>

<p>The Mid Atlantic Rise is named after the rise of the ocean floor in the middle of the Atlantic. You should expect that in the middle of the ocean the deepest depths would be found. In the days of the K18, this paradox was already known and gave many Earth scientists large question marks, but for the first time this irregular landscape was noticed and scientifically observed both as topography and gravity anomalies. Due to the crater characteristics the professor hypothesized a volcanic landscape.</p>

<p>How could these observations be explained? In 1934, the theory of plate tectonics was not accepted yet. Wegener 1912 {reference} wrote down the theory of plate tectonics in 1912. He theorized that the outer shell of the Earth was broken up in several pieces that moved relative to each other. At first, the full scientific community would not accept his theory. In the 1920s, 30s, and 40s, the scientific debate was high between the "mobilists" (they accepted the theory) and the "fixists" (critics of the theory). Vening Meinesz himself was a fixist. He, with a background in mechanical engineering (ref), did not believe that the Earth's crust could break. Eventually in 1960, undisputable evidence was attained in the field of pale magnetism. Magnetic anomaly strips on the ocean floor proved that parts of the crust were moving relative to each other. With this evidence the complete scientific community accepted the theory of plate tectonics.</p>

<p>It was Tusco Wilson how wrote an article {ref} that described the plate tectonics theory as a cyclic process, named after the writer, the 'Wilson cycle'. The Wilson cycle explains the creation, lifetime and destruction of the Earth's lithosphere. The figure gives a schematic representation of the Wilson cycle.</p>

<p>The birth of new lithosphere happens at mid oceanic ridges, like the Mid Atlantic Rise, where Vening Meinesz and the K18 sailed over just after the crossing of the aircraft 'Snip'. At the rise, two plates are moving away from each other, enabling hot mantle material rise to the surface. At the surface, the oceanic water cools this hot material, such that it becomes hard cold crustal material. New lithosphere is slowly being build as the two neighboring plates moves away from each other.</p>

<p>It were Turcotte & Oxburgh in 1966 that could explain the strange bathymetry with a cooling half-plate model using the motion of the plate, found by paleo-magnetism, and the theory of conduction in solids. The heating and cooling of a moving plate nicely predicted the bathymetry that prof. Vening Meinesz and the K18 crew observed in 1934. Even the irregular ocean floor could be explained by the volcanism at the ridge, which gradually was transported away from the ridge. The decrease of irregular surface away from the ridge could be explained by erosion. The volcanic area further away from the ridge was experiencing more erosion, because it was created longer ago.</p>

<p>Geophysical models using the theory of plate motions later nicely explained the geodetic observations done by prof. Vening Meinesz. This cooperation between the two scientific fields was also happening in the 1970s and 1980s. The rise of the Global Positioning System (GPS) gave geodesists the capability to observe tiny motions of the Earth's top plates. You have to think of velocities that are 1-10 mm/yr large, for example the joining plates on both sides of the Mid Atlantic Rise move away from each other with 2.5 cm/yr. New plates could be identified using the observations of the geodesists, resulting in 52 plates identified today. This shows that when geodesists and geophysicists work together, great knowledge can be created.</p>
