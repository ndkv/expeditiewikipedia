<p>Eventually in 1960, indisputable evidence was attained in the field of pale magnetism.</p>

<p>Magnetic anomaly strips on the ocean floor proved that parts of the crust were moving relativeto each other. With this evidence the complete scientific community accepted the theory of plate tectonics. It was Tusco Wilson how wrote an article {ref} that described the plate tectonics theory as a cyclic process, named after the writer, the "Wilson cycle". The Wilson cycle explains the creation, lifetime and destruction of the Earth's lithosphere. The figure gives a schematic representation of the Wilson cycle.</p>
