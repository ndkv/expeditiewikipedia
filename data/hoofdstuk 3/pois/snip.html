<p><em>Leaving St. Vincent, our route brought us far out into the Atlantic. This loop was due to the crossing of a Dutch areoplane to the Netherlands West Indies; for providing this plane with the necessary radio-bearings for its position and for giving it indications about the weather, Hr. Ms. K18 was ordered to be stationed for twenty-four hours at a point in the middle of the ocean.</em></p>

<p>What aircraft? It must be an important crossing, for having the Hr. Ms. K18 have to divert its route. It was the KLM's maiden voyage to the West Indies: A Fokker F18 (note the similar number.) made his 8 day voyage from Amsterdam, Holland to Curacao. The following poster (obtained from the website) shows the route of the Fokker F18. </p>
