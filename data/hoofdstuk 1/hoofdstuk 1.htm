<h1>The start of a journey</h1>

<p>Every journey, every voyage begins at a home port. For the Hr. Ms. K18 this port was Den Helder, a small town in the Northwest of the Netherlands. On November the 14th 1934, the longest journey ever made with a submarine was about to start. The, 75 meter long submarine, ‘Her Majesty’ K18 was lying at the docks of the Navy harbor in Den Helder. She was about to set sail to Soerabaya, Indonesia, to reinforce the submarine fleet in Dutch colonial waters. Commanded by captain “Lieutenant-commander” D. C. M. Hetterschy and the crew of the K18, she would prove to be a remarkable ship that would cross the world’s oceans without major setbacks. [Wijtema_1936 & Vening_1941] </p>

<p>
Onboard the K18 was a special guest, Prof. Felix Andries Vening Meinesz. During that time Vening Meinesz was professor at Utrecht and Delft [Vlaar_1987]. He had designed and tested his famous pendulum apparatus for performing high-accurate gravity measurements on sea. To acquire high-precision measurements, he needed submarines of the Navy to reduce the movement of the vessel due to wave motion. Thanks to the Dutch Navy he was able to perform these high accurate measurements in a global fashion. The voyage of the “K 18” would contribute enormously to his scientific accomplishments. Despite, the “K 18” being a military vessel and the journey would have a military purpose, it can be noticed that the work of Vening Meinesz played a very big role, when listening to the good luck speech of the Commander of the Navy, T. L. Kruijs minutes before the K18 would start the voyage [Polygoon_1936]:</p>

<p>Crew of the Hr. Ms. K18, you will experience the longest journey ever made with a submarine. The goal of this journey is to add the K 18 to the fleet of the Dutch Navy in the East Indies. Furthermore, this trip will be used to allow the professor Vening Meinesz to extend his important observations concerning the gravity. Finally, you will serve as a beacon for the planned KLM Christmas-mail flight to West Indie. I realize that this will test your physical state and especially your mood. When you keep remembering the high honor you will receive by participating on this journey, then I will have no doubt that you will put all your strength and let your commander succeed in his mission.</p>

<p>So as Kruijs states, the secondary objective of the K 18 is helping Prof. Vening Meinesz to measure Earth’s gravity field and extend his important scientific work.</p>

<p>
Follow the professor and the crew of the K18 in their adventure. Read about the world changing work of the professor on the voyage of the K 18. We will show the great scientific mind of Prof. Vening Meinesz and his devotion to science. In the process we will explain what gravity is and how it is used in Geodetic and Geophysical research. Gravity measurements prove to be especially useful in the investigation of the solid Earth. Furthermore, we will describe the adventures during the trip made by the crew and the professor. Along the way, they will visit exotic volcanic islands, cross paths with the first trans-Atlantic postal-flight of the “Snip”, sail over deep oceanic trenches, experience major storms, visit the remotest village in the world and visit the forgotten continent. In the end, they will sail more than 20,000 miles across the oceans of the Earth.

So please, start this journey around the world with us and discover the face of the Earth through the eyes of a gravity scientist.

<h1>Measuring the shape of the Earth</h1>

<p>With his pendulum apparatus, Prof. Vening Meinesz measured the gravity at the location of the submarine. Vening Meinesz documented all his gravity observations in submarines and published them in the series “Gravity Expeditions at Sea”. The measurements during the long voyage in the K18 are documented in Vol. III in tables presented in figure ??.</p>

<p>These tables listed the number of the measurement, time of measurement and location on the globe, with the calculated uncertainties. In column 9, the actual measurement, corrected for calibration issues, is listed. Starting close to Holland, the famous 9.81 m/s^2 from the Dutch high school books. Later on, it can be seen that this value decreases. So, what is gravity actually and why isn’t it constant over the complete Earth?</p>

<p>To answer this question, we have to go several years back in time. All the way back to 5 July 1687. It was the year that Isaac Newton published his most famous work, the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, explaining three laws of motion of an object, but also giving a description of the law of gravity</p>

<p>Every point mass attracts every single other point mass by a force pointing along the line intersecting both points. The force is proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.</p>

<p>This can also be written in a mathematical formula, showing the relationships of all the parameters.</p>
