<h3>Chapter 2: Madeira, St. Vincent, and Tristan da Cunha</h3>

<p>It was calm onboard the K18. The crew was doing its routines and the captain looked at his charts. They would arrive at the beautiful flower island, Madeira, within a few hours. The start of the voyage had been calm and good. Prof. Vening Meinesz had already done several measurements of the gravity field along the trip. Some coastal profiles were obtained, which supported some theories he was working on (read about this in chapter 5). </p>

<h3>Regional Isostasy: Supporting a volcano</h3>

<p>One of his greatest achievements to science is the theory of "Vening Meinesz isostasy" or "regional isostasy". This is a model that is quite powerful but greatly overlooked. The mathematical details can be found in ???, but a sort summary about the theory will be given in this chapter.</p>

<p>However, before his theorem can be explained, more basic gravity field modeling has to be explained. We start with explaining two different anomalies, which are frequently used in geophysical modeling, the free-air anomaly and the Bouguer anomaly. Gravity anomalies are corrected gravity measurements. </p>

<p>To obtain the free-air anomaly, gravity observation should be corrected for two effects. First, the reference ellipsoid, discussed in chapter 1, should be subtracted from the observations. This large signal is well known and therefore not interested for scientists, who are more interested in the deviations from the reference field. The second correction is not that important for Vening Meinesz, because he made all his observations at the same height. However, when the gravity field is measured in mountainous area, the height of the measurement could vary dramatically. This would introduce non-equality in comparing different gravity observations. Therefore, it was decided by geodesist that all gravity measurements should be referenced to the same height. This reference height is height of 0m, or in other terms, at sea level. This special surface is called the geoid and is directly related to the gravity field. This special field will be discussed in Chapter 8????. When both corrections are performed on the gravity measurements, the free-air anomaly is computed. Prof. Vening Meinesz knew about this anomaly and computed this as well. You can see the free-air anomalies of his measurements in column 12 of his observation tables (see fig. ??). These values are commonly given in mGal, because they are very small, 1 mGal = 10^-5 m/s^2. In plate ??? you can see the free-air anomaly of different areas on the globe. Compare it to topography and bathymetry. Do you see the correlation?</p>

<p>The second anomaly is called the Bouguer anomaly, after the scientist ???? Bouguer (????). This correction models the gravity signal of the topographic masses above sea level, above the geoid. </p>

<p>The Bouguer reduction is a simple approximation of the masses and is applied using the following equation:</p>

<p>Bouguer equation</p>

<p>The Bouguer correction, g_b, is computed using several parameters. Here G is the universal gravitation constant, rho is the density of the topographic masses, and h is the height of the topography at the observation location with respect to the geoid. A typical Bouguer anomaly map can be seen in Figure ??. </p>

<emph>Fig Topography, free-air and Bouguer anomaly map of same region.</emph>

<p>Notice the strong negative anomalies at mountainous regions. It was ???? Everest (), how first noticed this relation. He measured the gravitational pull of the Himalayas and compared it to a modeled gravitational attraction using his knowledge of the local topography. The measured gravitational attraction was only a third ???? of the theoretical value. Somehow, he had overestimated the mass of Himalayan mountains. As you can see in fig ???, every mountain range experiences this. The negative anomaly shows that we over-estimate the topography with the Bouguer corrections. Yet, the density that we use is correct, so there must another explanation. This is where isostasy comes into play.
</p>
<p>The word isostasy is not something you would use in a normal conversation. So, lets try to explain this concept. It all started with a man taking a bath. The story goes that this man was given a problem to solve for his king. The assignment was to find out if the new crown of the king was made of pure gold. The king suspected the goldsmith of using silver. Archimedes (the man) was asked to do this without melting it, which was a difficult question in ancient times.</p>

<p>Thinking long and hard, Archimedes did not solve the problem. So he decided to take a bath (scientific and engineering problem solving are done best in the bathroom). Submerging in the water he noticed that the water level was rising. This observation made him solve the difficult question of the king. Enthusiastic, he ran outside shouting, "I found it", or "Eureka", totally naked (every scientist should do this, I think it is liberating).</p>

<p>The Archimedes principle can also be used to calculate when things float. Objects float when the mass of the displaced water by the object is more then the mass of the object itself. When we talk about solid objects, this will mean that they must have a density, which is lower than the displaced water. In geoscience we use this principle to study the loading of mountains and ice-sheets.</p>

<p>When a mountain is in isostatic equilibrium, it sort of means that the mountain floats on the fluid mantle material. Ice and mountains have a lower density than the heavy materials in the mantle, which cause them to float. In the late 1800 two scientists devised a theory to explain this phenomenon. Vening Meinesz and Heiskanen wrote a beautiful piece about these two scientists in their book "The Earth and its gravity field":</p>

<blockquote>Quite frequently two scientists working independently discover an important phenomenon or perfect a significant invention simultaneously. It is well known that the English astronomer Adams, in October, 1845, and the French astronomer Leverrier, in the summer of 1846, independently computed the orbital elements of Neptune. Unfortunately for Adams, the new planet was discovered September 23, 1846, on the basis of Leverrier's computations. A similar thing happened in 1868, when the English astronomer Lockyer and the French astronomer Janssen without knowing each other's results invented a method for observing the prominences of the sun, which previously could be studied only during total solar eclipses. In 1892 both the American astronomer Hale and the French astronomer Deslandres invented the spectroheliograph, an important tool in the hands of astronomers. Einstein delivered a paper on his general theory of relativity on November 11, 1915, to the Academy of Sciences in Berlin, and on November 20 of the same year Hilbert gave at the Scientific Association of Göttingen the results of his investigation of a similar theory. (Don't forget the observation of the Jovian moons by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius, 1610)</blockquote>

<p>In the same way it happened that on January 25, 1855, the British astronomer G. B. Airy sent to the Royal Society his paper on the same equilibrium problem Pratt discussed before the same society on December 7, 1854.</p>

<p>Both Pratt and Airy had devised a theory that explained, why mountains wouldn’t sink under their weight in to the deep depths of the Earth. Pratt's theory states that mountain material has less density than material at coastal areas. This extra light material is more buoyant and is able to support the extra load of a mountain. Airy's theory puts a sub-crustal root beneath the mountain to give it more buoyancy. You can see this a bit like a floating iceberg. I made this following figure to explain Airy isostasy:</p>
